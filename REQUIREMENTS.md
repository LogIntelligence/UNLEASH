## Operating System & Hardware
We recommend using machines equipped with at least 4 cores, 16GB RAM, and ~50GB available disk space with **Ubuntu 20.04** or **Ubuntu 22.04** to stably reproduce the experimental results in our paper.  

## Software

- We develop UNLEASH using Python 3.9 (UNLEASH is compatible with Python 3.9+)
- We encourage user to create a virtual environment to use UNLEASH (e.g., `python3.9 -m venv env`).
- UNLEASH could be installed using pip. (e.g., `pip install unleash`).
- UNLEASH requires the following packages: `pytorch`, `transformers`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `pytest`, `tqdm`, `requests`, and `matplotlib`.
